Fast numerical calculation based on the extended King integral
==

# Overview
Matlab code for the simulations of `Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12` in the paper `Extended King integral for modeling of parametric array loudspeakers with axisymmetric profiles`.

# Usage
* Download the code and unzip it.
* Open the target script (the file named 'Demo_Fig~.m', e.g.ï¼Œ Demo_Fig9.m ).
* Click 'Run' and input the index of the subfigure you want to calculate.
* Wait a few minutes to get the figures.
