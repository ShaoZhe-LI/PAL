Fast numerical calculation based on the extended King integral
==

# Overview
Matlab code for the simulations of `Figs. 9, 10, 11, 12` in the paper `Extended King integral for modeling of parametric array loudspeakers with axisymmetric profiles`.

# Usage
* Download the code and unzip it.
* Open the target script (the file named 'Demo_Fig~.m', e.g.ï¼Œ Demo_Fig9.m ).
* Click 'Run' and input the index of the subfigure you want to calculate (the index can be 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f' without quotation marks, and see the comment in each script for ditais).
* Wait a few minutes to get the figures.
